## ðŸ’» About Me

I am a goal-oriented woman with three years of experience in the IT education sector and one month of practical experience in web development. My current goal is to deepen my knowledge in frontend, master core technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and learn how to write unit and integration tests. In the future, I plan to explore backend development as well.

My priorities are to grow as a web developer by building personal projects and learning continuously. I am actively developing my skills to obtain a Junior Developer position.
